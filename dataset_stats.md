Let me adjust the code to make sure all the relevant boxplots for features like `Age`, `Sleep Duration`, etc., are clearly visible in the figure. I'll also add some labels and improve the formatting for better clarity.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset_normal.csv')

# Identify numerical features
num_features = ['Age', 'Sleep Duration', 'Quality of Sleep', 'Physical Activity Level',
                'Stress Level', 'Heart Rate', 'Daily Steps']

# Set image resolution
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300

# Set the font for matplotlib
plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['WenQuanYi Zen Hei']
plt.rcParams['axes.unicode_minus'] = False

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Create boxplots for features except 'Daily Steps'
features_except_steps = [col for col in num_features if col!= 'Daily Steps']
df[features_except_steps].boxplot(ax=ax, positions=range(len(features_except_steps)))

# Create a separate axis for 'Daily Steps'
ax2 = ax.twinx()
df[['Daily Steps']].boxplot(ax=ax2, positions=[len(features_except_steps)], patch_artist=True, boxprops=dict(facecolor='red'))

# Set axis labels and title
ax.set_xticklabels(features_except_steps + ['Daily Steps'], rotation=45)
ax.set_ylabel('Values for Most Features')
ax2.set_ylabel('Values for Daily Steps')
ax.set_title('Descriptive Statistics of Numerical Features')

plt.show()
```


```STDOUT
```



Here is the updated visualization presenting the descriptive statistics of all the numerical features including `Age`, `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, `Physical Activity Level`, `Stress Level`, `Heart Rate`, and `Daily Steps`:

In this plot:
- The boxplots for `Age`, `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, `Physical Activity Level`, `Stress Level`, and `Heart Rate` are on the primary axis (left - hand side y - axis). Their distribution characteristics such as median, quartiles, and potential outliers can be easily observed.
- The boxplot for `Daily Steps` is on the secondary axis (right - hand side y - axis) and is colored red to distinguish it. This separate axis allows it to be shown on an appropriate scale due to its much larger values compared to the other features.
- The x - axis shows the names of all the numerical features for easy identification. The y - axis on the left gives the value range for the majority of the features, while the y - axis on the right is specifically for the values of `Daily Steps`. This setup enables you to effectively compare the distribution of all these numerical features within the same visual. 






I will plot visualizations for all features in the dataset. Since there are different types of features (categorical and numerical), I'll use appropriate plots for each. For categorical features like `Gender`, `Occupation`, `BMI Category`, and `Sleep Disorder`, I'll use bar charts. For numerical features like `Age`, `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, etc., I'll use histograms. For relationships between numerical features, I'll create scatter plots.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset_normal.csv')

# Set image resolution
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300

# Set the font for matplotlib
plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['WenQuanYi Zen Hei']
plt.rcParams['axes.unicode_minus'] = False

# Categorical features
cat_features = ['Gender', 'Occupation', 'BMI Category', 'Sleep Disorder']

# Numerical features
num_features = ['Age', 'Sleep Duration', 'Quality of Sleep', 'Physical Activity Level', 
                'Stress Level', 'Heart Rate', 'Daily Steps']

# Plot categorical features
for i, feature in enumerate(cat_features):
    counts = df[feature].value_counts()
    plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)
    plt.bar(counts.index, counts)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Plot numerical features
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(15, 8))
for i, feature in enumerate(num_features):
    row = i // 4
    col = i % 4
    axes[row, col].hist(df[feature], bins=20, edgecolor='black')
    axes[row, col].set_title(f'Distribution of {feature}')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Plot scatter plots for relationships between numerical features (taking a subset for simplicity)
pairs = [('Age', 'Sleep Duration'), ('Sleep Duration', 'Quality of Sleep'), 
         ('Physical Activity Level', 'Stress Level'), ('Heart Rate', 'Daily Steps')]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 8))
for i, (x, y) in enumerate(pairs):
    row = i // 2
    col = i % 2
    axes[row, col].scatter(df[x], df[y])
    axes[row, col].set_xlabel(x)
    axes[row, col].set_ylabel(y)
    axes[row, col].set_title(f'{x} vs {y}')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


```STDOUT
```



Here are the visualizations for all features in the dataset:

### 1. Distribution of Categorical Features

This set of bar charts shows the distribution of categorical features such as `Gender`, `Occupation`, `BMI Category`, and `Sleep Disorder`. You can observe the frequency of each category within these features. For example, from the `Gender` bar chart, you can tell the proportion of males and females in the dataset.

### 2. Distribution of Numerical Features

These histograms display the distribution of numerical features including `Age`, `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, `Physical Activity Level`, `Stress Level`, `Heart Rate`, and `Daily Steps`. They help in understanding the spread and central tendency of each numerical variable. For instance, the `Age` histogram can show you the most common age ranges in the dataset.

### 3. Relationships between Numerical Features (Selected Pairs)

This set of scatter plots depicts the relationships between selected pairs of numerical features like (`Age`, `Sleep Duration`), (`Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`), (`Physical Activity Level`, `Stress Level`), and (`Heart Rate`, `Daily Steps`). They give an initial indication of whether there is any linear or non - linear association between these pairs of variables. For example, from the scatter plot of `Sleep Duration` and `Quality of Sleep`, you can get an idea if longer sleep durations are associated with better sleep quality.
